                    Hey, thanks for stopping by! I’m Katelyn Manuel and here’s a little about me. I graduated from the University of 
                    Northern Colorado with a Bachelor’s Degree in French, so you could say I have a thing for languages. I found the 
                    world of web development by chance, but I’m super excited I did. The passion goes beyond the love of languages to 
                    design and user experience (so far). There’s nothing like visiting a website that speaks to you and functions in 
                    exactly the way you want it to. So, in a nutshell, that’s what I’m looking to pursue as a Full Stack Web 
                    Developer. I would like the opportunity to take a website beyond a service or product to create a memorable experience
                    and I'm excited to see what else is out there! Some things outside of coding? I've seen every episode of The Office an 
                    embarassing number of times, my favorite food is breakfast food, and I probably like music more than I like anything else.
                    Stop by my <a href="portfolio.html" class="aboutPageBioLinks" href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> to see some of my work or 
                    pop over to my <a class="aboutPageBioLinks" href="contact.html">Contact</a> page to drop me a note!
